# Babylonian-method-of-finding-a-square-root
A mini program implemented in c program to find square root of any float decimal with resizable precision points 

Algorithm for the Babylonian square root method: 
Start with an arbitrary positive start value x (the closer to the root, the better).
Initialize y = 1.
Do following until desired approximation is achieved.
  a) Get the next approximation for root using average of x and y
  b) Set y = n/x
  
You can use this method to find square root of any decimal value without the sqrt function.
